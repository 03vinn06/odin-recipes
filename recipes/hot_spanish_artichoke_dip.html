    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

        <li>24 mini sandwich rolls or 12 large</li>
